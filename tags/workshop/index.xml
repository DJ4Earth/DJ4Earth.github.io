The meeting served for project partners to get to know each other, present ideas, planned capabilities and existing tools, and share resources.
Day 1: AD &amp;amp; differentiable programming Goal of this first day is to present the current landscape and developments related to AD going on in the Julia world. Tools that have been discussed include Enzyme, Diffractor, … (Julia Lab, Julia Computing, ANL, …) A second theme is to showcase AD capabilities developed in Fortran for “physics-based” simulations.</description></item></channel></rss>
